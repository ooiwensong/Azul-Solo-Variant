# Azul Solo Variant

---

Azul is a popular boardgame designed by Michael Keisling. The theme of the boardgame is based on _Azulejo_ which is a form of painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework which can be found all througout Portugal and Spain.

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by placing different patterned tiles into a 5x5 grid wall in a specific order. Players will choose tiles from five sets of Factories and place them in their pattern lines first. Only when each line is completely filled can they move a tile into the wall. For more details, you can find the official rules [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/azul/game-rules.php).

This version of Azul is based on the unofficial solo variant rules by Ricky Royal where the player will be playing against an AI with a pre-written ruleset. You can find out more about how the AI makes its decisions [here](https://www.boxofdelights.net/azul).
